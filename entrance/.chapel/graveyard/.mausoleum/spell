# As you hastily scan the room, your gaze falls upon a tattered,
# ancient scroll partially protruding from beneath a crumbled
# chest. Ignoring the other trinkets, you pull it free, revealing
# faded runes scratched onto the fragile parchment. Unfurling the
# scroll, you recognize it as a spell of aid:
# 
# In decayed rooms where shadows stay,
# 'uniq' will charm the clones away.
#
# You can combine spells (commands) with a pipe (|) character.
# The "uniq" command omits repeated lines.
# Sort the room, and then pipe its output
# to "uniq" for a short list. Try the incantation:
#
# sort room | uniq
