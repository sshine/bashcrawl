# Inside the decayed mausoleum, you catch glimpses of
# tarnished silver urns, rusted candlesticks, and ornate chests
# scattered among the debris. The grand chamber is filled with
# relics of a bygone era, half-buried and cloaked in dust. 
#
# It would be unwise to sift through the loot, for there are
# often traps protecting the belongings of the dead.
#
# Check the contents of the room with:
# 
# cat room
#
# Once you have found the number of the correct item, pick it up
# by running the "loot" script.
