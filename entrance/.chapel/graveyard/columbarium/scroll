# Before you is the columbarium, a weathered stone structure
# adorned with carvings of angels and vines. Rows of niches
# line its walls, some with long burnt-out candles, others
# with worn inscriptions and small tokens of remembrance.
#
# Many have distinctive symbols on their front. Maybe you 
# can find one that is helpful.
#
# If you think you have found the right niche, you can touch
# it with the following command:
# 
# touch <number of niche>
#
# This creates an empty file in the current room (directory).
# After you have created the file, try to "open" the niche.
#
# If you know a spell that helps you search, you can make it easier
# for yourself.
