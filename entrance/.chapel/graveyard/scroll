# The graveyard is a haunting place, shrouded in mist and silence.
#
# Rusted iron gates creak in the cold wind, leading to a field of
# weathered tombstones, some cracked and others half-hidden by ivy.
#
# Twisted, barren trees loom over the field, with branches like
# skeletal fingers reaching toward a perpetually overcast sky.
# The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay.
# Every footstep on the gravel path seems to echo in
# the oppressive stillness.
#
# A dark and crumbling mausoleum stands ominously in the
# centre, its door secured with an old rusty padlock.
