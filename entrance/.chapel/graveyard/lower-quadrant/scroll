# In the lower quadrant of the graveyard, the land dips slightly,
# and fog clings to the uneven ground. The gravestones here are
# modest and small, many leaning with age, with inscriptions
# barely legible beneath creeping ivy.
#
# The air is damp and heavy, carrying the scent of wet earth and
# decay. The faint sound of trickling water from an unseen stream
# accentuates the stillness of the graveyard.
#
# As you try to make sense of the gravestones, a spell comes
# to your mind that could be helpful.
# You can sort the gravestones by date with the spell:
#
# sort gravestones
#
# Once you do this, look for a familiar name and take 
# note of the year of death. Add the year to your Inventory:
#
# export I=<year of death>,$I
