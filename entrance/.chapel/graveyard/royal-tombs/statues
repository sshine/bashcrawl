Standing in front of the statues, you are thinking about the symbols
on the padlock. Do you have an item in your inventory that looks familiar?

You hold the crown in your hands, pondering where to place it.

You come upon a solitary grave marked by a grand statue of a king,
his once-majestic figure now weathered and worn. The crown
that once adorned his head is missing. Vines climb the statue's base,
weaving around the king's feet.

As you gently place the crown on the statue's head, a low rumble
echoes through the ground, and the stone king's eyes slowly open,
glowing with an ethereal light. The statue shifts, raising its arm
to reveal a hidden engraving on the baseâ€”a secret number, **7432**
etched in ancient script. It faintly pulses gold, and the king nods
solemnly to you before returning to stillness.

Remove the crown from your inventory:

export I=\$(sed 's/crown,//' <<< \$I)

Remember the number by adding it to your inventory:

export I=7432,\$I

EOF
            mv statues king
        else
            cat << EOF

The weathered gravestone is flanked by ivy-clad pillars, while a
majestic marble statue stands atop it. The statue, depicting a serene
figure in royal attire with a tilted crown, gazes out solemnly. Around
the base, broken lanterns and cracked urns hint at past grandeur,
their silence only interrupted by the rustling leaves and distant
raven calls.

As you adjust the crown on the statue's head, it slips from its
precarious perch and falls to the ground with a clatter.
In that instant, a dark shimmer of magic escapes from the statue,
wrapping around you with an unsettling chill.

            let HP=HP-5
            export HP
            if [ "$HP" -le 0 ]; then
                cat << EOF
A wave of unease washes over you, and a heavy weight seems to settle in
your chest. You are slain by the magic.

                exit 1
            else
                cat << EOF
The magic leaves you feeling disoriented and uneasy, as if shadows
of the past have momentarily clouded your mind and sapped your strength.

Deduct 5 from your HP variable:

let "HP=HP-5"

    else
        echo "You don't have it! Continue searching."
        echo
        exit
    fi

else
    cat << EOF
You step back from the statues, continuing your search for the Item.
