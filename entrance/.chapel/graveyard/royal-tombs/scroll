# As you enter the plot of royal graves, a sense of faded grandeur
# fills the air. The once imposing gravestones, crafted from marble
# and adorned with royal crests, now show signs of neglect, their
# surfaces weathered and chipped. Moss creeps up the bases of the
# monuments, and the intricate carvings of crowns and heraldry are
# worn by time.
#
# A few of the grandest tombs have cracked open, iron gates rusted
# and askew. The stone angels and lions, meant to stand as vigilant
# guardians, are more forlorn than proud. It is quiet here, save for
# an occasional rustle of dry leaves and the distant call of a crow 
# echoing through the stillness.
